# Scrabble Cheater

A command line application that outputs all the possible words with their scrabble score, given a user's set of letters.

### Files

[Directory] **word lists in csv** - Directory with 26 csv files of english words - accessed from (https://www.bragitoff.com/2016/03/english-dictionary-in-csv-format/)

**creating_scrabble_dictionary.py** - There were a few data cleaning actions I needed to perform on the csv files: join all the files into one, remove empty lines, remove lines with non alphabetical characters, remove repeat words, and more.

**scrabble_dictionary.csv** - The final, desired output of all the english words along with their corresponding scrabble scores in each row of a csv file

**script.py** - The main script which the user interacts with to find their scrabble words!

### How to use
1) Download the directory to your local computer

2) Create a virtual environment to install python (??)

3) Run the script.py file in your command line and have a go!
